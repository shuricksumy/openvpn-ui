# OpenVPN WEB UI

Simple OpenVPN instance for Raspberry Pi based home server. 

## Summary
OpenVPN server web administration interface.

Goal: create quick to deploy and easy to use solution that makes work with small OpenVPN environments a breeze.

It does include 2 different Docker containers:
 - OpenVPN Back-End container (openvpn) and 
 - OpenVPN UI WEB based Front-End container (openvpn-ui) for managing OpenVPN server.

## Features

* Status page that shows server statistics and list of connected clients
* Easy to **generate**, **download**, **revoke** and **delete** client certificates
* You can set static IP to clients and
* Add secret passphrase during client certificate generation
* Easy to preview OpenVPN Server logs, as well as do
* Chaneing of OpenVPN Server configuration via web interface
* You can restart OpenVPN Server Back-End container via Web UI
* Web-UI Admin user and password can be passed via environment variables to container
* Support any architecture, AMD64 and ARM64v8 [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/d3vilh/openvpn-ui).
* Easy-rsa 3.X
* Openssl 3.X
* Beego 2.1 with all vulnerabilities fixed
* OpenVPN 2.5.8 Server is fully compatible
* Compatible OpenVPN Server images can be found on Docker Hub - [d3vilh/openvpn-server:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/d3vilh/openvpn-server)
* As well as Openvpn-UI itself - [d3vilh/openvpn-ui:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/d3vilh/openvpn-ui)

Part of following cool projects:
* [Openvpn-aws](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws) is a x86-64 fork of openvpn-ui project build to run on Amazon AWS t2-mini enviroment.
* [Raspberry-gateway](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway) simple yet powerful home gateway environment with Pi-Hole +Unbound, VPN, Torrent client and Internet monitoring, all managed by Portainer.

``` 

## Run this image using the Docker itself

### First, build the images:

To build the image for **ARM CPU** you'll have to follow [openvpn-ui-docker-build](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-ui-docker-build) instructions.

To build the image for **x86_64 CPU** you'll have to follow [openvpn-ui-docker-build-amd64](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-ui-docker-build-amd64) instructions.

Run the OpenVPN-UI image
```shell
docker run \
-v /home/pi/openvpn:/etc/openvpn \
-v /home/pi/openvpn/db:/opt/openvpn-gui/db \
-v /home/pi/openvpn/pki:/usr/share/easy-rsa/pki \
-v /home/pi/openvpn/log:/var/log/openvpn \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-e OPENVPN_ADMIN_USERNAME='admin' \
-e OPENVPN_ADMIN_PASSWORD='gagaZush' \
-p 8080:8080/tcp \
--privileged local/openvpn-ui
```

Run the OpenVPN image:
```shell
sudo docker run openvpn \
    --expose 1194:1194/udp \
    --mount type=bind,src=./openvpn/pki,dst=/etc/openvpn/pki \
    --mount type=bind,src=./openvpn/clients,dst=/etc/openvpn/clients \
    --mount type=bind,src=./openvpn/config,dst=/etc/openvpn/config \
    --mount type=bind,src=./openvpn/staticclients,dst=/etc/openvpn/staticclients \
    --mount type=bind,src=./openvpn/log,dst=/var/log/openvpn \
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    --restart=unless-stopped
    --privileged openvpn
```

## Documentation
Most of documentation can be found in the [main README.md](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway) file, if you want to run it without anything else you'll have to edit the [dns-configuration](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/openvpn/config/server.conf#L20) (which currently points to the PiHole DNS Server) and
if you don't want to use a custom dns-resolve at all you may also want to comment out [this line](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/openvpn/config/server.conf#L39).

## Configuration
**OpenVPN WEB UI** can be accessed on own port (*e.g. http://localhost:8080 , change `localhost` to your Raspberry host ip/name*), the default user and password is `admin/gagaZush` preconfigured in `config.yml` which you supposed to [set in](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/example.config.yml#L18) `ovpnui_user` & `ovpnui_password` vars, just before the installation.

The volume container will be inicialized by using the official OpenVPN `openvpn_openvpn` image with included scripts to automatically generate everything you need  on the first run:
 - Diffie-Hellman parameters
 - an EasyRSA CA key and certificate
 - a new private key
 - a self-certificate matching the private key for the OpenVPN server
 - a TLS auth key from HMAC security

This setup use `tun` mode, because it works on the widest range of devices. tap mode, for instance, does not work on Android, except if the device is rooted.

The topology used is `subnet`, because it works on the widest range of OS. p2p, for instance, does not work on Windows.

The server config [specifies](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/openvpn/config/server.conf#L40) `push redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp`, meaning that after establishing the VPN connection, all traffic will go through the VPN. This might cause problems if you use local DNS recursors which are not directly reachable, since you will try to reach them through the VPN and they might not answer to you. If that happens, use public DNS resolvers like those of OpenDNS (`208.67.222.222` and `208.67.220.220`) or Google (`8.8.4.4` and `8.8.8.8`).

If you wish to use your local Pi-Hole as a DNS server (the one which comes with this setup), you have to modify a [dns-configuration](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/openvpn/config/server.conf#L21) with your local Pi-Hole IP address.

### Generating .OVPN client profiles

Before client cert. generation you need to update the external IP address to your OpenVPN server in OVPN-UI GUI.

For this go to `"Configuration > Settings"`:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OVPN_ext_serv_ip1.png" alt="Configuration > Settings" width="350" border="1" />

And then update `"Server Address (external)"` field with your external Internet IP. Then go to `"Certificates"`, enter new VPN client name in the field at the page below and press `"Create"` to generate new Client certificate:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OVPN_ext_serv_ip2.png" alt="Server Address" width="350" border="1" />  <img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OVPN_New_Client.png" alt="Create Certificate" width="350" border="1" />

To download .OVPN client configuration file, press on the `Client Name` you just created:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OVPN_New_Client_download.png" alt="download OVPN" width="350" border="1" />

If you use NAT and different port for all the external connections on your network router, you may need to change server port in .OVPN file. For that, just open it in any text editor (emax?) and update `1194` port with the desired one in this line: `remote 178.248.232.12 1194 udp`.
This line also can be [preconfigured in](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/example.config.yml#L23) `config.yml` file in var `ovpn_remote`.

Install [Official OpenVPN client](https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/) to your client device.

Deliver .OVPN profile to the client device and import it as a FILE, then connect with new profile to enjoy your free VPN:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OVPN_Palm_import.png" alt="PalmTX Import" width="350" border="1" /> <img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OVPN_Palm_connected.png" alt="PalmTX Connected" width="350" border="1" />

### Revoking .OVPN profiles

If you would like to prevent client to use yor VPN connection, you have to revoke client certificate and restart the OpenVPN daemon.
You can do it via OpenVPN WEB UI `"Certificates"` menue, by pressing "Revoke" amber button:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OpenVPN-UI-Revoke.png" alt="Revoke Certificate" width="600" border="1" />

Revoked certificates won't kill active connections, you'll have to restart the service if you want the user to immediately disconnect. It can be done via Portainer or OpenVPN WEB UI from the same `"Certificates"` page, by pressing Restart red button:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OpenVPN-UI-Restart.png" alt="OpenVPN Restart" width="600" border="1" />

After Revoking and Restarting the service, the client will be disconnected and will not be able to connect again with the same certificate. To delete the certificate from the server, you have to press "Remove" red button.

### OpenVPN client subnets. Guest and Home users

[Raspberry-Gateway](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/) OpenVPN server uses `10.0.70.0/24` **"Trusted"** subnet for dynamic clients by default and all the clients connected by default will have full access to your Home network, as well as your home Internet.
However you can be desired to share VPN access with your friends and restrict access to your Home network for them, but allow to use Internet connection over your VPN. This type of guest clients needs to live in special **"Guest users"** subnet - `10.0.71.0/24`:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/OVPN_VLANs.png" alt="OpenVPN Subnets" width="700" border="1" />
</p>

To assign desired subnet policy to the specific client, you have to define static IP address for this client after you generate .OVPN profile.
To do that, just enter `"Static IP (optional)"` field in `"Certificates"` page and press `"Create"` button.

> Keep in mind, by default, all the clients have full access, so you don't need to specifically configure static IP for your own devices, your home devices always will land to **"Trusted"** subnet by default.
